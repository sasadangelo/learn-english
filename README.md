# How to learn English (or whatever language) quickly

## My English History

I'm from Italy and like many italians I have always struggled a lot to learn English. I studied English in high school without ever reaching a decent level. At the Univeristy many textbooks were in English and unfortunately at the time there were no course to learn this language well. Anyway, after several years my level of understanding has increased so much that I am able to understand 80% of those books and use it to pass my exams. At the time Internet was not very widespread and I had a lot of difficulties with spoken English.

Few years later, I started working for an American company and that agreed to hire me despite my English being acceptable. On Day 1 I started to attend my first English conference call and it was a nightmare. That day I decided that I should try harder in studying English. Unfortunately, despite my efforts my level did not increase as I wanted.

The classical methods proposed by many books and courses, seemed not working for me. 

## What's wrong with Classical teaching methods?

The approach of many English books and courses try to figure out your current level and propose to you reading and writing exercises, study of grammar, and CD or DVD to learn pronunciation. 

**What's wrong with this approach?**

First of all, you try to memorize lots of grammar rules that you easily forgot when you are speaking with native English or when you try to write a text document. It's hard to memorize all new words and use them easily when required. Your pronunciation is bad and this cause fatigue when you try to understand native English when they speak and, at the same time, it's hard for them understand you.

Your learning is constantly based on translation and this affects your fluency so you always have hard time when you try to speak with someone else.

This approach is completely different from the methods we used when we were young and we learned our native language. Our parents started to teach us few words at a time (mom, dad, food, milk, hello, etc.) with the correct pronunciations and show everytime the object representing that word. As we increased our skills we started to create easy sentences (Mom I'm hungry, Mon I'm thirsty, and so on). They didn't teach us grammar rule but we started to incorporare them with these easy sentences and with the constant corrections of our parents when we did mistakes.
